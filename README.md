# Introduction

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for the TMM 2025 paper titled "Eliminating Moiré Patterns Across Diverse Image Resolutions via DMMNet" by Yikun Ma, Haoran Qi, and Zhi Jin.

# Abstract
The occurrence of frequency aliasing between the camera and high-frequency scene elements causes moire patterns in images, leading to color distortions and a loss of fine details, thereby reducing image quality. The intricate frequency characteristics and diverse appearances inherent in moire patterns render their removal, commonly referred to as demoireing, particularly challenging. Recent advancements in deep learningbased demoireing methods have showcased notable efficacy. However, prevailing techniques often specialize in mitigating moire patterns exclusively within either the frequency or spatial domains. Additionally, these methods generally perform well at specific image resolutions, but struggle to maintain effectiveness across different resolutions due to less generalized architectures. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-domain Multilevel Multi-scale Network DMMNet, working in both spatial and frequency domains sequentially. The Multi-scale Multi-level Demoire Stage (MMDS) in our framework focuses on moire patterns removal in the spatial domain. To adeptly integrate
features from various semantic levels, we introduce a pioneering plug-and-play Adjacent Cross Attention (ACA) module within the MMDS. Subsequently, the Frequency Separation and Reconstruction Stage (FSRS) restores high-frequency texture details, reconstructs color information, and eliminates residual moire patterns in the wavelet frequency domain. Ultimately, the clean image is obtained by converting it back to the spatial domain. Extensive experimental assessments, spanning both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual evaluations, attest to the superior efficacy of DMMNet to State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) demoireing methods, concurrently exhibiting enhanced generalization for demoireing across diverse image resolutions. We posit that the proposed methodology presents a viable solution for broader applications in the realm of demoireing.
